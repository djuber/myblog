This is my personal set of notes. I used to work in [webhosting](https://www.wiredtree.com/about/) on [cPanel](https://cpanel.com/) systems during the day. I've moved on and work now as a Support Engineer for a ruby on rails app in the security space.

I'm started using this as an excuse to both get information down on paper, keep a set of field notes of what I've tried and done, and make more regular use of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).


I have a possibly out of date [resume](https://djuber.tk/) available.
