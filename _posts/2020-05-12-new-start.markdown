I'm starting a new role tomorrow as a developer.
I'm a little concerned about the need to appease a project manager,
but I have a good feeling about the team and its place in the company, I understand the project
they're (we're) working on, and I'm excited to actually get to work on specific tasks.

It's partly a shift in direction from what I had been doing, partly a resum√© control action (I don't want to get more invitations to connect about systems engineering or site reliability roles right now) and largely a realignment of what I'm already doing with a group thinking about the same problems.

In the end, it's all about doing your best work with smart people you like being around. Someday in the future maybe we'll be together in one place again.
