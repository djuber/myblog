I've started reading Puppet 4 Essentials. I'm trying to set this up on Fedora 24, it seems
like the authors both used wheezy, and installed puppetlabs packages. The path of least 
resistance should have been for me to use ```dnf install puppetserver``` or the like, and I 
did get the master instance in place. Fedora's charming default firewall might be making 
this unpleasant on my end, I'll need to hammer through this. So Fedora specific notes.

* Fedora team seems to have abandoned use (not support) of puppet, see [Fedora Project Infrastructure](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Puppet)
* The instructions from puppet.com strongly suggest using their yum repo via [rpm](https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-fedora-24.noarch.rpm)

Fedora Infrastructure notes point out these directories and files:

Puppet Master (server):

*    /etc/puppet - Basic puppet configuration information
*    /etc/puppet/manifests - node config mappings
*    /etc/puppet/manifests/filetypes/* - Various filetype definitions
*    /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes/* - Server lists and what classes[1] they use
*    /etc/puppet/manifests/server-groups - Maps services with a server type
*    /etc/puppet/manifests/service-types - Contains each service and whats required for that service
*    /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp - Contains the 'root' config file which includes other config files
*    /var/lib/puppet/ - Puppet files
*    /var/lib/puppet/config - Config files for our actual nodes (eg httpd.conf)
*   /etc/lib/puppet/bucket - Backup of overwritten config files 

Puppet client

*   /etc/puppet - Basic configuration information
*   /etc/sysconfig/puppet - Puppet startup definitions 


Additionally, while I'm able to run the server directly, the bundled systemd 
file gives a permissions error on /usr/bin/puppet, and I'm suspecting the 
service is set to set the uid to puppet or similar (a service account that is not root). 

```start-puppet-master[8594]: /usr/bin/start-puppet-master: line 8: /usr/bin/puppet: Permission denied```

Root can run the program directly without any error:
```/usr/bin/start-puppet-master master```

It does not look as though there should be any permissions issue:

```
# stat /usr/bin/puppet
  File: '/usr/bin/puppet'

However, all of the puppet config files and directories are set root owned. 
That might include a logging directory, in which case running as root once
might break the non-privileged user forever until that's fixed. 
It's just disheartening that this doesn't work out of the box. 
I might test in jessie later today to get a second opinion.
