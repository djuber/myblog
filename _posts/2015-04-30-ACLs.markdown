# ACL Overview
[RedHat Docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/acls-setting.html) cover this.

See also the [manpage](http://linux.die.net/man/5/acl)

# ACL Support
ACL will only work if the partition is mounted with acl as a mount option
(ext4), or the filesystem always supports acls (xfs?). 

# ACL Tools

* getfacl
* setfacl
