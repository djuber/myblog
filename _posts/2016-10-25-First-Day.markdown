So this was my first day. I was well prepared for the parts I expected. 
I brought a passport, and filled in forms for a while. 
I got a badge to open the door (I'm excited to be keyless). 

I signed in, checked email, and signed in some more. 
I can log in to lots of things now, and have enough leeway to probably 
do some unfortunate damage if I'm careless. 
I have a desk to myself now, which is interesting and awesome. 

I had a half day, so apart from learning how to log into various systems,
I didn't really get my feet wet. The rest of the week (promptly) was more interesting.
