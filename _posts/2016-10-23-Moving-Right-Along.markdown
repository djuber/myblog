# Leaving WiredTree
I had the exasperating and exhilarating experience of leaving my last job. 
I spent about two months looking for work. I had a very slow start, and 
my experience the last few times I've looked for work has led me to believe
that a lot of companies are bad at aggressively pursuing candidates. 

I applied at a lot of places, strictly in Chicago, strictly in linux roles.
Some form submissions became form rejections, I'm comfortable with that. 
I did have the initial problem that all the resumes sent for the first two weeks
had the wrong phone number on them, and my resume is spare, I don't like to 
over fill it with keywords. 

I had a number of experiences with recruiters, some were excellent, very hands on,
and at each step I was prepared and know what to expect. Some were aggressive,
and I probably had a few phone interviews that I wouldn't have had otherwise. The job
I've just taken at Mbira Technologies, was handled by CPS, which is a company I'm not 
sure I'd otherwise heard of. Jobspring always seems friendly, though I haven't talked to
any of their team in a long time (Samantha reached out to me a year or more back, and if 
I ever need to look for work I might contact her in addition to CPS). I interviewed over 
the phone with Braintree, and probably would have taken a job there if they were a bit faster,
they initially rejected my application, then followed up a few weeks later. I think I learned
more from their code challenge than I have from any other task, it was both open ended in how
you achieve it, specific in what needs to be done, and testable. I was able to leverage the 
small experience I got from solving their problem to gain confidence and insight that translated
into more well-rounded skills when I interviewed at Mbira.

# Going to Mbira

So I'm moving out of web hosting, into, well, more website hosting, but this time for one 
site and all of its IT, no cpanel, and very limited external clients.
I'm pretty excited, it's going to be life changing to have dinner together with Beth
rather than lunches, and I look forward to filling my evenings
with general nerdery. The computer crowd in Chicago has a rich network of meetups and 
hack nights, geared toward the 9-5 downtown set, and I've been excluded from basically 
everything since I started working shift work at WT. I'm glad to be back in the daylight.
