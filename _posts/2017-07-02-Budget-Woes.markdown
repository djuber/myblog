It's been a fantastic week for fans of dysfunction. Sunday afternoon house sessions,
a return to the once vilified "Quinn" tax, with a 0.05% Rauner freedom discount.
Doing your homework on Sunday after the Friday due date is so my style,
I have to hand it to the legislature.

It will certainly be an interesting year.
