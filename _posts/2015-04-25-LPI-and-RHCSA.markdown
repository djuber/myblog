Another certification in Linux system administration is the [ LPIC ](https://www.lpi.org/certification/),
this is a less stringent certificate as it's a multiple choice exam
that only tests knowledge, rather like a CLEP exam for linux. Having
taken CLEP tests in the past, and received passing grades in a broad
range of subjects, it's my opinion that this might be a limited gauge of
competence (and the reason RHCE and RHCSA are lab based only). The
advantages, of course, are that the multiple choice exams are easier,
so if you're looking to get a basic certification and put a stamp on
your resume, this might be the right place to start. Certainly, nothing
in the vendor neutral LPI exam will be a hindrance to working toward the
RHCSA test, and some authors suggest that this level of competence is
appropriate to starting on the path to the redhat certificates.

[Exam Objectives]( https://www.lpi.org/study-resources/lpic-1-101-exam-objectives/) for the LPIC 101 exam. It's clever to see that dpkg and rpm based package
management receive equal footing there. You need to register for an LPI ID, and either order a voucher from LPI to take the tests at one of the testing centers, or you can register via CompTIA and take the exam to earn the LPIC-1 plus [CompTIA Linux+](http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/linux.aspx) at the same time.
