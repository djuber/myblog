I sometimes wonder if I, having spent a fair amount of effort to 
understand how to work effectively with lisp, have become brain damaged
by ruby. When I was in college, I remember getting an assignment dealing
with a SAT solver, and the people who came from a java background asked
if there was a library to ingest the clause document format.

I just wrote a dirty parser to pull in lines and generate clauses instead
and wondered if this dependence on other code was a problem tied to their
education or to the habits their language gives them.

I've worked a lot with ruby lately, and will continue working with a mix 
of ruby and javascript for the foreseeable future. I don't know what that
means but I feel like I am needing to make a concerted effort to either
get really deep into fundamentals or work in really different languages.

I'd love to love clojure, but I can't care enough about it to overcome the difference in tooling. I think I'll try to use ocaml to solve either euler or advent of code problems, and I have access to the competitive programming books (which assume c++ generally) and might take a look at those. I need to be more comfortable with javascript than I am, but I wonder if the kind of language javascript is becoming (declarative, modular, strict, typed) and the kind of language javascript was (function and value based, prototypical, permissive) are at odds with one another. 

I had exposure to typescript at my last job. I didn't make use of that and treated it as a funny tooling in front of JS. That's probably fine for some kinds of maintenance, I understand you can't work or think that way in development.
