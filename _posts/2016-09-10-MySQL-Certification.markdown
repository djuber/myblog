I looked at other possible certifications. I see oracle offers both very expensive professional training (about $500 per day for a four day course to learn basic mysql), and more modestly priced certifications. For example, [MySQL 5.6 Database Administrator](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-883) is $245 and covers what looks like very basic options. I don't know about deployment on windows, but the topics seem pretty rudimentary to someone who actually uses and manages mysql.

* MySQL Architecture

**    Use MySQL client programs to interface with the MySQL Server interactively and in batch
**    Describe how MySQL uses disk and memory resources

**    Tune MySQL Server configuration for best performance.
**    Apply best practices in optimizing schema objects
