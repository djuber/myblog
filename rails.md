# Notes about Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

Ruby on Rails [Doctrine](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine) has notes about the Principle of Least Surprise. It points to python:

    $ python
    >>> exit
    Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit

Python pedantically instructs the programmer how to properly do what’s requested, even though it obviously knows what is meant (since it’s displaying the error message).
